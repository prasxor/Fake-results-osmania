# Osmania University Fake Results Website

This project is a humorous and creative attempt to mimic the official Osmania University results portal. Created during the second semester of my studies, the primary purpose of this project was to bring some light-hearted fun to my classmates during a stressful time of waiting for exam results. By designing a fully functional yet entirely fake results website, I managed to entertain my peers while showcasing my budding web development skills.

## Features

- **Interactive Input:** Allows users to enter a Hall Ticket Number to generate results.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Fake student data, including personal details, subject names, grades, and GPA, is displayed based on predefined inputs.
- **Responsive Design:** The website adjusts seamlessly to various device sizes.
- **Export Options:** Includes buttons for "Print Page" and "Download PDF" to simulate a real results website experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactivity and data manipulation.

## How It Works

1. **Input Hall Ticket Number**: Users input a hall ticket number into the search box.
2. **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Based on the hall ticket number, predefined data (stored in JavaScript objects) is displayed.
3. **Randomized Grades and GPA**: Subject grades and GPA are randomly assigned from predefined lists to enhance the fake results' authenticity.
4. **Gender Assignment**: Gender is dynamically assigned based on specific hall ticket numbers.

## Code Highlights

- **Dynamic Rendering**: JavaScript functions are used to dynamically render personal details, subject information, and results based on user input.
- **Randomization**: Random grades and GPA values are assigned to make each result unique and unpredictable.
- **Interactive UI**: Buttons for printing and downloading results create a real-world portal-like experience.
